# RandomizeData
This program reads a file (named "input.txt") and then just randomize all its lines.
The output is another file (called "output.txt") which contains the result.

NOTES:
- The input file needs to be on same folder of "RandomData.java".
- It requires a "input.txt" file, otherwise an error is returned.
